    "The most important thing to understand about ML is that it represents a fundamentally different approach to creating software: The machine learns from examples, rather than being explicitly programmed for a particular outcome. This is an important break from previous practice. For most of the past 50 years, advances in information technology and its applications have focused on codifying existing knowledge and procedures and embedding them in machines. Indeed, the term “coding” denotes the painstaking process of transferring knowledge from developers’ heads into a form that machines can understand and execute. This approach has a fundamental weakness: Much of the knowledge we all have is tacit, meaning that we can’t fully explain it. It’s nearly impossible for us to write down instructions that would enable another person to learn how to ride a bike or to recognize a friend’s face."
